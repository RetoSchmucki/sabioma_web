  SABIOMA is an international partnership between Argentina and the UK, working on nature-based solutions to tackle the challenge of biodiversity loss, climate change and social wellbeing. Our main objectives are to develop knowledge, build capacity and define tangible actions for conservation, restauration and sustainable use of land and the environment. Through our research activities, our consortium focus on providing knowledge to food producers, policy-makers, land managers and the public who need better evidence based tools to support decision making for sustainable outcomes.
